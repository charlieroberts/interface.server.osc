Interface.Server.OSC
====================

This module is used to send / receive OSC messages inside Interface.Server.

To use it, make sure you have `OSC` declared as a transport inside the Interface.Server config file and have the module installed. Once these two steps are completed, OSC should be a valid transport option for the server.
